Right to Food in the World System

This work was my final thesis to receive the combined Data Science and International Affairs degree from Northeastern University, and I am exceptionally proud of it. This project assesses the right to food across the world economic system. Based on Salvatore Barbones's remarkable Excel-based tool, this work innovates a Python based version that offers more analysis and visualization capabilities and combines it with an assessment of the global right to food. I identified three benchmarks denoting the increasing commitment global nations have made to the right to food. Pulling data from the World Bank Development Indicators, this work offers an innovative way to perceive the distribution and development of international human rights.
